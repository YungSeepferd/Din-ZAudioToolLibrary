## 🏗️ Repository Structure (Clean & Organized)

### Root Directory (Essential Only)
```
CLAUDE.md ................................. Context & tools reference (24 KB)
CLAUDE_CODE_QUICK_START.md ................ 5-min Claude Code setup
QUICK_REFERENCE.md ....................... Common commands
README.md ................................ Project overview
.mcp.json ................................ MCP configuration
pnpm-workspace.yaml ...................... PNPM workspaces
package.json ............................. Root package
turbo.json ............................... Turborepo config
```

✅ **Clean**: No feature-specific docs in root

### Docs/Projects/LoFi-Piano (Organized)
```
docs/projects/lofi-piano/
├── README.md ............................ Entry point ⭐
├── QUICK_START.md ....................... 5-minute guide
├── ROADMAP.md ........................... 12-week plan
├── PROJECT_SUMMARY.md ................... What was created
